   OTP LOGIN:
   OTP is generated, bcrypt-hashed, stored, and verified on the
   backend exactly as before (5-min expiry, single-use, rate
   limited). Point API_BASE_URL at your deployed backend (see
   /backend/README-DEPLOY.md for how to deploy it for free).

   CHANGED — OTP DELIVERY NOW VIA EMAILJS (sent from the browser):
   The backend's server-side SMTP (Gmail/nodemailer) was unreliable
   on the free hosting tier, so OTP emails weren't reaching
   customers. /api/send-otp now returns the OTP in its response,
   and THIS file sends it to the customer's inbox using EmailJS
   (emailjs.com — free tier, sends straight from the browser, no
   backend SMTP involved). Fill in the three EMAILJS_* values below
   after setting up a free EmailJS account — see
   /frontend/README-EMAILJS.md for exact steps.

   3) sweeps any wa.me links already rendered before the fetch finished,

   footer (same spot the newsletter box uses), showing the overall
   business rating + up to 5 real reviews from /api/reviews.
   Falls back to a small hardcoded set if the API fails/unreachable,
